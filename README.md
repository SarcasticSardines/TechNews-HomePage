### 1440
For 1440, the desktop looks good. However, here are some things I noticed
-the “bright future of web3.0” text looks a lil too big
-the read more button is supposed to be lower down near the end of 3.0 to the left
-the navbar could use some more padding top and bottom
-on the bottom 3 images, the text should be as tall as the image

Good job on making the headings clickable I didn’t even notice that on mine
### on screen sizes 769 -992
 -the navbar sections disappeared and there’s no button 
### screen size 375 
	-I noticed the spacing isn’t	lined up. Its a little knit picky but on the figma the left side on all the elements are lined up.
